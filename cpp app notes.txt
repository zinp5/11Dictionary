c++ can be difficult to makes apps,, gui frameworks can suck,, cpp is only good for game engines
	instead create web app, use java script and electron, c sharp, c#
gui - graphical user interfcae - set of tools to create applications -  has blt in components like windows buttons - ui elements
cli - command line interface
or you can use imGui,, the better gui for cpp
	(should know how to use namespace)

for c++:
	qt
	wxWidjets
	fltk
	SQLite for backend
		you could also ignore it altogether and do plaintext, writing and reading from a file holding all words <----- this is something you are capable of

if doing plaintext, use json, csv, or txt for word storage
